This is a simple consol program that uses the new USPS address validation API to validate an address.
The USPS API needs a valid token issued by USPS which can be retrieved by the program when it's provided with a valid client ID and Client Secrect. Below are the steps to get the client ID and Secrect from USPS registered account.
  1. You must have an account with USPS by signing up on their developer portal https://developer.usps.com/
  2. Once you've registered, add the "Address" app under your account.
  3. In your "Address" app, copy the Client ID and Client Secrect and paste them to the variables in the program accordingly.
